## Stack
A stack is a data structure which resembles a list in which you can push (insert) and pop (remove) elements except you can only access the top of the stack.

__Exemple__:

1. You start with an empty stack: `[]`.
1. Then you can push an element `E1` in it: `[E1]`
1. Then an other element `E2` in it: `[E2, E1]`
1. Why not a third `E3` in it: `[E3, E2, E1]`
1. Then you can pop: `[E2, E1]`.

The key element to remember is: __You can only touch the top of a stack.__
